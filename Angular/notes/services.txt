Services are used to store common data and to provide communication between any components.
you can create a service by command 
" ng generate service service-name"
it will create two file i.e., one ts and one .spec.ts files and spec.ts is used for testing and actual service lies in .ts

services are initialized with @Injectable decorator stating that these services can be injectable into any other services

How to use Service:
 -- import service in any components
 -- create an instance for that service in constructor parameter of that component


Dependency Injection: it is one of the fundamental concept in angular.By creating instance in the constructor parameter angular makes the component/pipes/directive independent from its dependencies

HTTP CLIENT:
httpClient in angular is used to handle http requests. http requests such as GET,POST,DELETE,PUT,PATCH

httpClient returns observable similarly as fetch returns promises
observable means multiple asynchronous functions
we resolve observable by subscribe

1. Goto module , import httpClienModule. it is deprecated in 17 & 18 because 17 & 18 it is in built. , write it in imports
2. Goto component or service , inject httpClient
3. using httpClient instance access GET,POST,PUT,DELETE methods
